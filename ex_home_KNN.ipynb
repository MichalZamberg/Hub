    "K Nearest Neighbours: \n",
    "KNN is a simple supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks, and is also frequently used in missing value imputation. It is based on the idea that the closer an observation is to a set of other observations - it is most likely of a \"similar\" nature. We can therefore classify unforeseen points based on the values of the closest existing points. By choosing K, the user can select the number of nearby observations to use in the algorithm. \n",
    "For classification, a majority vote is often used to determine under which class a new observation should fall into: find the K nearest neighbours, and check out of\n",
    "these K neighbours which label is the most common - and classify the new observation with this label.\n",
    "In this exercise you will implement a K-nearest neighbours algorithm on the famous built-in Iris dataset in Python. We will do this in few small steps. \n",
